# supernote cloud sync

Author: Dylan Mazurek

I recently purchased a Supernote Nomad A6X2 and wanted to start a project to create a syncing platform and golang supernote api client.

Current functionality:
- login to supernote cloud
- get user info
- get equipment binding status
- get list of files

Future functionality:
- download files
- upload files
- keep local folder in sync with cloud
